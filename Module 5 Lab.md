# Module 5: Designing and implementing Azure Site Recovery solutions

### Lab: Protecting on-premises Hyper-V virtual machines using Azure Site Recovery

Every enterprise needs a plan for business continuity and disaster recovery (BCDR) in the event that systems go offline or are damaged beyond repair. [Azure Site Recovery](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/site-recovery/) fills this need by offering a Backup service for replicating mission-critical data in the cloud, and a Site Recovery service for replicating workloads on physical and virtual machines to secondary locations and failing over to those locations when the primary location suffers an outage.

In this lab, you will use the Azure Site Recovery service to implement a site-recovery solution for a workload hosted in a Hyper-V virtual machine.

## Exercise 1 - Create a VM that supports nested virtualization

For this lab, you will use a more powerful VM than the one you used in previous labs. The new VM has four virtual CPUs, 16 GB of RAM, and a 32 GB SSD drive. It also supports [nested virtualization](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/nested-virtualization-in-azure/), which is essential for the exercises in the lab. In this exercise, you will create that VM, and then create a Hyper-V virtual machine inside it.

### Task 1, Install VM with Nested Virtualization


1. Using the steps outlined in Module 1, Lab A, create a new Windows Server 2016 virtual machine named **Main-Lab5-VM3** with the following changes:

	- Place the VM in a new resource group named **Lab5-RG**
	- Set the VM size to **D4s v3**

	Don't forget to enable RDP on the VM, too. Otherwise, you won't be able to remote in.

1. Once the VM is deployed, remote into it, start PowerShell **as an administrator**, and execute the following commands in the PowerShell console:

	```powershell
	Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
	Install-WindowsFeature Hyper-V,Hyper-V-Tools,Hyper-V-PowerShell
	```

1. Now use this command to restart the virtual machine:

	```powershell
	Restart-Computer
	```

1. Reconnect to the virtual machine. Click the Windows **Start** button. Then click **Windows Administrative Tools**, and underneath that, click **Hyper-V Manager** to launch the Windows Hyper-V Manager.

1. In the Hyper-V Manager console, right-click the machine name (MAIN-LAB5-VM3) in the treeview on the left and select **New -> Virtual Machine...** to launch the New Virtual Machine wizard.

1. Click **Next**. In the "Specify Name and Location" page, name the virtual machine **VM1**, and then click **Next**.

1. Accept the defaults on all other pages. Then click **Finish** on the Summary page.

1. Confirm that VM1 appears in the list of virtual machines hosted on MAIN-LAB5-VM3.

1. Close the Hyper-V Manager console.

As a reminder, you should use Server Manager to disable IE's enhanced security configuration for administrators, too. It makes using the Azure portal in the VM much easier.


### Task 2 Install Windows Server 2016 Core on VM1

1.  In the browser, navigate to:  https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/

2.  Scroll down and Click Windows Server, and then select Windows Server 2019

3.  Select ISO, and then Continue.  Fill out form as required, and then click Continue.

4.  Select your language, and then click Download.  Save to the Downloads directory.

5.  After the iso download finishes, in The Start menu, go to Administrative Tools, and then **Hyper-V Manager**.

6.  In Hyper-V Manager, double click VM1, and in the Media menu, select **DVD Drive**, and then **Insert Disk**.   In File Explorer, select the downloaded iso.  Now click 
the **Start** button on the VM1 Virtual Machine Connection window.

7.  Install Windows Server 2019 Core, using all defaults.  Use a Custom installation.

8.  When VM1 boots up after install, it will require you to create an administrator password.  Use **Pa55w.rd**

9.  Close the VM1 Machine Connection Window.

## Exercise 2 - Prepare your environment for Site Recovery

In this exercise, you will create an Azure virtual network, a storage account, and a Recovery services vault â€” all part of the infrastructure necessary to leverage Azure Site Recovery.

### Task 1: Create an Azure virtual network

1. In the Azure VM that you created in the previous exercise, navigate to the Azure portal at https://portal.azure.com. If prompted, sign in using the Microsoft account that is the Service Administrator of your Azure subscription.

1. Click **+ Create a resource** in the menu of the left side of the page. Then click **Networking**, followed by **Virtual Network**.

	![Creating a virtual network](Images/new-virtual-network.png)

1. Enter the following settings into the "Create virtual network" blade, and then click **Create**:

	- Name: **lab5-vnet**
	- Address space: **10.5.0.0/20**
	- Subscription: Select your subscription
	- Resource group: **Lab5-RG**
	- Location: **East US**
	- Subnet name: **subnet-0**
	- Subnet address range: **10.5.0.0/24**
	- DDoS Protection: **Basic**
	- Service endpoints: **Disabled**
	- Firewall: **Disabled**

1. Do not wait until the virtual network is provisioned. Instead, proceed directly to the next task.

### Task 2: Create an Azure storage account

1. Click **+ Create a resource** in the menu of the left side of the Azure portal. Then click **Storage**, followed by **Storage account**.

	![Creating a storage account](Images/new-storage-account.png)

1. Specify the following settings for the storage account:

	- Subscription: Select the same subscription you used in the previous task
	- Resource group: **Lab5-RG**
	- Storage account name: Enter a unique name from 3 to 24 characters in length consisting only of numbers and lowercase letters
	- Location: **East US**
	- Performance: **Standard**
	- Account kind: **Storage (general purpose v1)**
	- Replication: **Locally-redundant storage (LRS)**

	It is important to choose **general purpose v1** (not **general purpose v2**) as the storage-account type because Azure Site Recovery currently does not support v2 storage accounts.

1. Click **Review + create** at the bottom of the blade. Then click **Create** once the settings are validated.

1. Do not wait until the storage account is provisioned. Instead, proceed directly to the next task.

### Task 3: Create an Azure Recovery Services vault

1. Click **+ Create a resource** in the menu of the left side of the Azure portal. Then click **Management Tools**, followed by **Backup and Site Recovery (OMS)**.

	![Creating a Backup and Site Recovery instance](Images/create-site-recovery.png)

1. Enter the following settings, and then click **Create**:

	- Name: **Lab5-vault**
	- Subscription: Select the same subscription you used in the previous task
	- Resource group: **Lab5-RG**
	- Location: **East US**

1. Wait for the vault to be provisioned before proceeding to the next task.

Upon completion of this exercise, you have successfully created an Azure virtual network, an Azure storage account, and a Recovery Services vault. Now let's configure the host and the vault.

## Exercise 3 - Configure a Hyper-V host for site recovery

In this exercise, you will configure the VM1 virtual machine for site recovery. This will involve configuring the Recovery Services vault that you created in the previous exercise, registering the Hyper-V host and the VM for replication and recovery, creating a replication policy, and creating a recovery plan.
