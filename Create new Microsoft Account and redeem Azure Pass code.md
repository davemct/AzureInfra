**IMPORTANT NOTE:** If you have already registered or activated a 200\$ free trial of Azure or an Azure Pass before, you will need to use this Azure pass on *another account* as only one trial offer can be activated per account.

It needs to be a new account\--not one you\'ve used before.

To create another Microsoft Account:

1.  In a browser, navigate to [www.outlook.com].

2.  Click the **Create free account** button

3.  In the **Create account** window, type in a **unique email address**. For the purpose of our class, you can use **Miami.*your-first-name*.Nov18**, and then press the Tab key. If this proves to not be unique enough, type you last name initial after the first name.

4.  For the **Password**, use **Pa55w.rd** If this is not allowed, try **\@Pa55w.rd**

5.  Add you first name and last name, for example, First Name: **Miami.Dave**; Last name: **Nov18**

6.  **Add details** window. Keep country or region as **United States**. For birthdate, it needs to be at least 18 years old on the present day. Choose one that meets this requirement.

7.  Enter the characters as shown.

8.  That should be it!

**Write down account name and password!!!**
